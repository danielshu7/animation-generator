# 3258-Assignments

Assignment 5 is submitted in the assignment5 branch.  

Images should be located in the "images" folder. Scripts should be located in the "scripts" 
folder.  

I generated the image found in "test.tif" with the script "final.txt".
It took approximately 3.3 seconds.  

*NOTE: For some reason glFlush() is still not working perfectly... this time with the CLEAR 
command (last time was RESET).  Sometimes it works properly on the first try, but sometimes the 
screen will take a few seconds or a few tries before it is cleared.# animation-generator
