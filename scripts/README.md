# Scripts
All input scripts should be placed within a directory.  Scripts should be named in alphabetical order according to frame number.  
split_scripts.py provides the functionality to break a mega-script with all frames written in it into individual files.  
resize.py provides the functionality to easily replace the screen sizes of a mega-script.
